1. "Agent" Class: This is the base class for all agent personas. It will be defined in "agent_base.py" and imported in all "agent_personaX.py" files.

2. "Loop" Class: This is the base class for all loops. It will be defined in "main.py" and imported in all "loopX.py" files.

3. "PromptEngine" Class: This class will be defined in "prompt_engine.py" and used in "main.py" and all "loopX.py" files.

4. "PromptChain" Class: This class will be defined in "prompt_chain.py" and used in "prompt_engine.py".

5. "Utils" Module: This module will contain utility functions and will be used across multiple files.

6. "Test" Classes: These classes will be defined in each "test_X.py" file and will test the corresponding classes or modules.

7. "Agent Skills" Variable: This variable will store the skills of each agent and will be used in "agent_personaX.py" and "loopX.py" files.

8. "Agent Backgrounds" Variable: This variable will store the backgrounds of each agent and will be used in "agent_personaX.py" and "loopX.py" files.

9. "Brainstorming Ideas" Variable: This variable will store the ideas generated by the agents and will be used in "loopX.py" and "main.py" files.

10. "Prompt" Variable: This variable will store the current prompt and will be used in "prompt_engine.py", "prompt_chain.py", and "loopX.py" files.

11. "evaluate", "create", and "solve" Functions: These functions will be defined in "agent_base.py" and overridden in "agent_personaX.py" files.

12. "run" Function: This function will be defined in "main.py" and call the functions of the "Loop" and "PromptEngine" classes.

13. "generatePrompt" and "chainPrompts" Functions: These functions will be defined in "prompt_engine.py" and "prompt_chain.py" respectively.

14. "startLoop" and "endLoop" Functions: These functions will be defined in "loopX.py" files.

15. "test_X" Functions: These functions will be defined in each "test_X.py" file and will test the corresponding classes or modules.
